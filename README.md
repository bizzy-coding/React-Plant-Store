# React Plant Shop

Welcome to the React Plant Shop repository by Laura Bizzle! This project combines my love for houseplants with a passion for refining UX/UI and React development skills. The aim is to create a fully interactive plant store, showcasing information about my own houseplants in a referenceable format, while also simulating the experience of an eCommerce store.

## Features

- **Plant Cards**: Each plant is represented by a card that displays the plant's image, name, price, and a "Buy" button.
- **Alert on Purchase**: Clicking the "Buy" button triggers an alert, simulating the addition of the item to a shopping cart.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the web application is usable on a variety of devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Utilised for its efficient rendering and state management capabilities, perfect for handling the dynamic aspects of the shop.
- **Vite**: Employs Vite as the build tool for fast development and builds.
- **CSS**: For styling components. Only basic styles have been applied currently; design will be revisited at a later stage.

## Future Enhancements

- **Full Plant Collection**: I will add detailed information about all the plants I have at home, stored in a JSON object and looped through to dynamically display each plant.
- **Finalised Filtering System**: Currently working on plant filters, and I plan to complete this section to allow users to sort and filter plants by factors such as growth rate, care difficulty, and more.
- **Complete Store Design**: The store is currently in the wireframing stage in Figma. Once the functionality is fully in place, I will move forward with finalising the design for a polished user experience.
